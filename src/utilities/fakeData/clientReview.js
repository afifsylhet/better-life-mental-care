Consumers provided feedback about the need for individual and group support and the ability for them to access extra support at times when this was needed.",

Their feedback described their experience in accessing case management as hit or miss, but when they had good support models it was mainly through community sector organisations. Broadly, comments indicated that case management took a proactive approach and provided a more holistic/whole-of-person focus including looking at the broader issues such as employment, relationships and accommodation that can impact on their mental health.",

Many participants wanted a system that considered their illness in similar terms to physical illness and highlighted diabetes as an example, that it would most likely be with them long-term, but their treatment plan should be focused around their capacity to be well, rather than treating the illness only. This would involve a broader focus on life domains such as relationships, employment and leisure, and not just on medical needs.",

Many consumers said this was their GP, and there was usually a positive outcome.",
